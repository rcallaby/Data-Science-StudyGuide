## Content Guidelines

### Do:

- Base all content on **verifiable, reputable sources** (e.g., university syllabi, published textbooks, research papers, official docs)
- Cite references wherever possible
- Explain **why** something matters, not just what it is
- Add **code examples** (Python preferred, R acceptable in relevant sections)

- Copy-pasting content from copyrighted materials
- Including broken links or outdated technologies
- Inserting opinions without evidence
- Adding commercial links or self-promotion

---

## Style Guide

Please follow these style rules for consistency:

- Write in **clear, concise, and conversational** English
- Use **American spelling** (e.g., “modeling” not “modelling”)
- Use Markdown headers consistently (`## Section`, `### Subsection`)
- Use `code blocks` for code and commands, not inline quotes
- Use bullet points for lists and avoid dense paragraphs
- Cite tools or libraries with links on **first mention** only
